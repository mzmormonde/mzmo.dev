<h3> About my site </h3>
<p font-size: 18px;"> I created this site shortly after learning html, css, and javascript. It is an absolute work in progress and I am always trying to think of new things to add and ways to improve it. <br><br> I created this site totally from scratch, so it still has some rough spots and things I am working on, but I hope you enjoy it anyway <img align="center" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/263a.png?v8"  width="20px"><p>

<h3> About these projects linked </h3>

<p font-size: 18px;">Match game and Higher/Lower were two assignments done during a summer html/css/javascript basics course. During this course I learned more about these 3, along with bootstrap and other tools. They are pretty simple, but fun nonetheless. <br><br> Hackathon links to a project I did for a hackathon in August of 2021. It was my first hackathon ever and wow, did I not figure out how to make a character based game fast enough. I ended up doing a super simple quiz based game using Zim.js which was super interesting to work with. <p>
