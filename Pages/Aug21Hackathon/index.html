        <h2>Mintbean Hackathon August 2021</h2>
        <section>
            <div class="row">

                <p>
                    Hey all! So this is something totally new and unfamiliar that I did. I had never done a hackathon
                    before but when I heard about this one
                    and how it was apparently a pretty chill and relaxed hackathon, I thought, why not?? I had been
                    wanting to try doing on for quite
                    a while, but thought they were all very much out of my reach. I was super excited when I heard the
                    prompt was building a game and I had SO
                    many ideas. What I did NOT realize was how confusing it would be to try and learn about sprites and
                    character movement and level building
                    in a short timeframe, especially as someone with pretty limited knowledge on web development and
                    frontend work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended up not being able to figure these things out in a reasonable time frame and ended up just
                    rolling with a trivia game of sorts.
                    It is definitely a much plainer project than I had originally planned to do, but I had the
                    opportunity to learn a ton about Zimjs which
                    was compltely unfamiliar to me and found I thoroughly enjoy it! It is definitely a really cool
                    framework and includes some amazing
                    examples and tools to be used. I absolutely think this will be something I will be coming back to
                    and using again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this experience was definitely not what I had planned on day 1, but it still ended up being an
                    awesome experience and I plan to continue
                    working on this project, probably adding more questions and working in some form of save method to
                    save the level that a user is on. I am super
                    grateful to have had this opportunity to not only continue working on learning Javascript/html/css
                    but also bringing in a framework that I
                    had never even heard of and become familiar with it as well. I am absolutely looking forward to
                    jumping into more hackathons as well ðŸ˜„.
